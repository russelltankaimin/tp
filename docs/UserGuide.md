You may locate the Person List at the center-left of `EduMate`. This is where you will see all your saved contacts (or sample data if you are trying out for the first time).

<img src="images/UG_ui_pictures/contact_list.png" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">

<center>Diagram 3: Person List with some contacts displayed.</center>

### Profile Panel

The Profile Panel allows you to display your own or your contact's information.

The Profile Panel will display basic information like your / contact's name, phone number, email address, nearest home station and the modules you are taking in NUS.

<img src="images/UG_ui_pictures/user_profile.png" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">

<center>Diagram 4: Sample user profile displayed on Profile Panel.</center>

### Command Box

The Command Box is where you can input the [Commands](#commands) when using `EduMate`.

The Command Box is located at the bottom of the application. You may refer to the [User Interface](#user-interface) section to locate it.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Pro Tip:** <br>
Did you know that the UP and DOWN arrow keys can be used to quickly access previously typed commands in the Command Box? This feature has been specially designed for you to save time and increase your productivity.<br>
<br>
In the current session, all of your previously typed commands can be accessed using the UP and DOWN arrow keys. Additionally, we automatically save up to 100 of your most recent commands to a file for your convenience in the next session. This way, you can easily refer back to your previous commands without having to retype them, saving you time and increasing your efficiency.

</div>

### Command Response

The Command Response box is where you will receive feedback for any command you execute. It could give you some information if the command execution was successful or if you had executed a command of an invalid format.

The Command Response box is located directly below the [Profile Panel](#profile-panel) and above the [Command Box](#command-box).

## Set Your Own Profile

Once you have familiarized yourself with EduMate, you are now ready to begin customizing the application to suit your preferences and needs!

**Step 1.** Run `java -jar eduMate.jar`. The application window will open and show you where you have left off
(if you have tried out `sample` from earlier) <br>

**Step 2.** On the Command Box, execute `edit n/[YOUR NAME] p/[YOUR CONTACT NUMBER] t/@[YOUR TELEGRAM HANDLE] 
s/[NEAREST MRT STATION TO YOUR HOUSE] e/[YOUR EMAIL]`
<br>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
You do not have to enter all your information at once! You can omit some of the information
and **its corresponding prefix** and enter them in the future!
<br>


Moreover, eduMate will replace the missing fields with placeholders which you
can then edit over later!

</div>

**Step 3.** To add the modules that you are studying as such :
`tag m/[MODULE_CODE] DAY START_TIME END_TIME`
<br>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
E.g `tag m/CS2103T MON 8 10 m/CS2101 WED 14 15`

</div>

**Step 4.** To add groups that you currently belong to as such: 
`tag g/[GROUP_NAME]`
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
E.g `tag g/SoC g/Sailing`

</div>


**Step 5.** You are done! Enjoy! <br>

## Commands

EduMate is a command-driven application, which means that its various functionalities can be accessed by executing specific commands.

### How to interpret the command format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Basic Command Format**<br>

* The first word is the type of command that you are running.<br>
  e.g. for the command `delete 5`, we are running the `delete` command.

* We use [Prefixes](#prefixes) like `p/` and `g/` to label our arguments for the command. Additionally, we use numbers to specify the index of contacts in our list.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 n/Steven Tan` runs the `edit` command with an index of 2 and an `n/` argument of Steven Tan.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are arguments you are meant to fill in.<br>
  e.g. in `view n/NAME`, you can fill in the `NAME` argument like `view n/Tan Kah Kee`.

* We use `z/` to denote any prefix.<br>
  e.g. `z/FIELD` could mean `n/FIELD` or `s/FIELD`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [g/GROUP]` can be used as `n/Tan Kah Kee g/Friend` or as `n/Tan Kah Kee`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[m/MODULE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `m/`, `m/CS2108 m/CS2101` etc.

* Unless otherwise specified, arguments can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME s/STATION`, `s/STATION n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If an argument is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last** occurrence of the argument will be taken.<br>
  e.g. `p/86544145 p/81353055` will be interpreted as `p/81353055`.

* Unnecessary arguments will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. `help 123` will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

**:warning: Invalid Command Formats**<br>

* Indices must be positive numbers.<br>
  e.g. `delete one` is not an accepted command.

* [Prefixes]() must be preceded by a space.<br>
  e.g. `sort m/an/Tan` is not an accepted command for prefixes `m/` and `n/`.

</div>

Now that you have become familiar with the basics of EduMate, it's time to explore its more advanced features. For a more guided experience, you can run the `sample 100` command to navigate through this section.

### Search Commands

The search commands in EduMate help you to efficiently navigate and manage your contacts. Instead of manually searching through a long list of contacts, these commands allow you to customise how EduMate displays them, making the process much more efficient.

#### Filter contacts by keywords `find`

EduMate's `find` command helps you quickly locate specific contacts by searching for keywords within their fields. This tool allows you to generate a list of contacts that meet certain criteria and manage your contacts more efficiently. 

To use the `find` command, simply type `find` followed by the relevant keywords or criteria. 

The command can also be used with multiple prefixes to refine your search. The results returned will contain at least one keyword from each specified field. Use the `find` command to save time and easily locate the information you need.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Format** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>
* `find z/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]... z/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

</div>

<center>Diagram 14: Only contacts tagged with CCA and CS2100 are shown.</center>

<br>

##### Explanation:

Say you want to filter out contacts who are in the same CCA as you to study for the upcoming finals for CS2100. `find g/CCA m/CS2100`
will filter out contacts who have are tagged with CCA and CS2100.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Examples**<br>

* `find m/CS2103T CS2109S`: Returns all persons with modules CS2103T or CS2109S
* `find n/Edward Richards`: Returns all persons with names Edward or Richards
* `find p/9093`: Returns all persons with phone numbers starting with 9093
* `find n/Edward m/CS2103T` : Returns all persons with name Edward and module CS2103T
* `find n/Edward Richards m/CS2103T CS2109S` : Returns all persons named Edward or Richards with module CS2103T or CS2109S.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: Tips on usage<br>
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g hans will match Hans
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Hans Bo will match Bo Hans
* Only the field specified by the prefix is searched. e.g. n/ means only the name field is searched
* Words matching the first part of the string will be matched e.g. Han will match Hans
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. Hans Bo will return Hans Gruber, Bo Yang

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

**:warning: Filtered list**<br>

* The `find` command returns a filtered list, so command operations only work on persons present in the filtered list.<br>
  e.g. If the filtered list does not contain any person with contact index 2, any operation relating to contact index 2 will throw error.
* If you want to run commands related to persons not in the filtered list, just run the `list` command to obtain the full list of your contacts.

</div>


#### Arrange contacts based on criteria `sort`

With EduMate's `sort` command, you have the power to organize your contacts in a way that's most helpful for you. Whether you want to find out who shares the most modules with you or who's likely to become a close friend this semester, the `sort` command can help you out. 

By simply typing `sort` followed by the relevant criteria, you can sort your contacts by name, the number of shared modules, or any other specified field. This feature can help you identify potential study or social groups within your contacts, making it easier to connect and collaborate with others.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Formats** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>
* `sort`: Sorts the contacts by their indices.
* `sort z/a`: Sorts the contacts by their `z` attribute **in ascending order**
* `sort z/d`: Sorts the contacts by their `z` attribute **in descending order**
* `sort z/`: Sorts the contacts by their `z` attribute based on our **default ordering**
* `sort z1/ z2/`: Sorts the contacts by their `z1` attribute, and breaks ties using their `z2` attribute
* `sort [z/]...​`: Sorts the contacts by multiple attributes

</div>

We will now teach you how to effectively use the `sort` command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: How we sort the attributes:

* The `NAME`, `EMAIL`, `STATION`, `PHONE` and `TELEGRAM` attributes are sorted by alphabetical order, and is default in **ascending** order.
* For `GROUP`, we sort the contacts based on the number of groups the contact belongs to. By default, we sort in **descending order**.<br>
  e.g. if Alex has 2 groups (TA, NS), and Ben has one group (TA), Alex will be placed before Ben in the default ordering.
* For `MODULE`, we sort the contacts based on the number of **common modules** they share with you. By default, we sort in **descending order**.<br>
  e.g. if Alex has 2 modules (CS1101S, CS1231S), Ben has one module (CS1101S), and you have 2 modules (CS1231S, MA2001), then Alex has 1 module in common with you (CS1231S) and Ben has 0 modules in common with you. As such, Alex will be placed before Ben in the default ordering.

<center>Diagram 16: Contacts ranked according to sorting criteria specified in the Command Box</center>

<br>

##### Explanation:

The command `sort m/d n/a` would mean that `EduMate` would first sort contacts by decreasing number of common modules with you, and tie-break by increasing alphabetical order.

Hence, Alex Quinn is ranked higher than Astrid Holland as Alex's name is lexicographically smaller than Astrid even though they share the same common modules as you.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Examples**<br>
* `sort n/d`: Sorts by name in descending order
* `sort m/a`: Sorts by the number of modules they have in common with you (in ascending order)
* `sort t/`: Sorts by Telegram handle in its default ordering (ascending)

</div>


### Storage Commands

The storage commands allow you to save and load your EduMate data into a file. This means you can easily backup your data and access it from different devices or share it with others.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: You can use these commands if:
* You want to create backups of your EduMate
* You want to explore the functions of EduMate without fear of losing your data
* You want to maintain multiple versions of EduMate

</div>

#### Save a copy of EduMate `save`

Using the `save` command in EduMate, you can easily save your data into a file with a name of your choice. This allows you to back up your data and access it later or share it with others.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Format** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>

</div>

### Meet Commands

The `meet` command in EduMate is used to suggest suitable meet-up locations and times for users and their contacts, based on various criteria such as availability and proximity. It is useful for finding a mutually convenient time and place to meet up with friends or study partners. EduMate also offers more specialized commands such as `eat` for suggesting places to eat and `study` for suggesting places to study.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Format** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>
* `meet INDEX_1 INDEX_2 ...`
* `study INDEX_1 INDEX_2 ...`
* `eat INDEX_1 INDEX_2 ...`

</div>

<center>Diagram 17: Recommended study spots and the common available days and timings displayed</center>

<br>

##### Explanation:

After sorting your contacts, you decided to ask Astrid, Grover, Kevin and Alex from your CCA to study for CS2100. You can execute the `meet` command
whilst referring to their index on the Person List and find out what are the most optimal places and the best possible time to meet and study for the final.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Examples**<br>
* `meet 12 32 8 4` : Recommends a meeting time and location for a potential meetup with friends with the following indices `12, 32, 4, 8`.
* `eat 5 2 8 1 3` : Recommends a meeting time and eating spot for friends with the following indices `5, 2, 8, 1, 3`
* `study 6 2` : Recommends a meeting time and study spot for friends with the following indices `6 and 2`.

</div>

### Schedule Commands

The `organise` command in EduMate is used to add meet ups with selected contacts, whether they are customised or recommended by the meet commands. It is useful for keeping track of your upcoming meetups in an organised and efficient way. In addition, EduMate also offers the `unorganise` command, which helps you manage and clean up scheduled meetups by removing them - making it easy to stay on top of your schedule.

#### Organise a meet up `organise`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Format** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>
* `organise INDEX`
* `organise INDEX_1 INDEX_2 ... d/DAY T/START_TIME END_TIME l/LOCATION`

</div>

<center>Diagram 18: A new meet up: Monday 8AM to 11AM at Queenstown Public Library is added to <code>EduMate</code>.</center>

##### Explanation:
After deciding you want to meet with Samantha and Ian, you execute the `meet` command to generate recommended timings and locations. Scrolling through the list of recommendations, you decide that Queenstown Public Library on a Monday morning sounds the best. You can then execute the `organise` command to add that recommendation to your scheduled meet ups list.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Example 1 : Adding a meet up from the recommendation list**<br>
* `organise 1`: Adds the recommendation with index 1 on the [Meet Up Recommendation Panel](#meet-up-recommendation-panel) to the [Scheduled Meet Up Panel](#scheduled-meet-up-panel).

:bulb: **Example 2 : Adding a customised meet up**<br>
* `organise 1 3 d/TUESDAY T/10 11 l/Starbucks`: Adds a customised meet up with the following details to the [Scheduled Meet Up Panel](#scheduled-meet-up-panel):
  * Participants: `contacts with index 1 and 3`
  * Day: `TUESDAY`
  * Start time: `10AM`
  * End time: `11AM`
  * Location: `Starbucks`

</div>

#### Unorganise a meet up `unorganise`

If you wish to remove a scheduled meetup from your [Scheduled Meet Up Panel](#scheduled-meet-up-panel), simply use the `unorganise` command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Format** (See [Interpreting Command Formats](#how-to-interpret-the-command-format)):<br>
* `unorganise INDEX`

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

:bulb: **Example : Removing a meet up from the scheduled meet up list**<br>
* `unorganise 1`: Removes the scheduled meet up with index 1 on the [Scheduled Meet Up Panel](#scheduled-meet-up-panel).

## FAQ

**Q**: Can I add multiple module tags to a user
**A**: Yes, you can add multiple tags to a single user by using the "Module Tagging" feature multiple times.

**Q**: Can I edit my own profile?
**A**: Yes you may! Refer to [Editing a Contact's Details](#edit-a-contacts-details-edit)

**Q**: How is `EduMate` better than Microsoft Outlook or uWave?
**A**: We have features that Microsoft Outlook or uWave don't have but we think should be integrated into these platforms, like the [meet up recommenders](#meet-commands)
and several search functions like [sort](#arrange-contacts-based-on-criteria-sort) and [find](#filter-contacts-by-keywords-find). It is also open-source so student developers can 
suggest new features and it is easily extensible!
